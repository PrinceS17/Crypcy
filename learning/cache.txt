When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. On the blockchain, smart contracts allow for code to be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. The Ethereum network went live on July 30th, 2015 with 72 million Ethereum premined."

Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency. \n\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially."

It is reportedly the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach, and one of the first to be built in the Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.  The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers. The protocol reportedly features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a treasury system."

Similar to cash, Dash allows you to remain anonymous while transacting. Dash protects privacy by anonymizing transactions that are made over the network using a technology developed by the Dash team called DarkSend. DarkSend is inspired by the CoinJoin project that was birthed to anonymize Bitcoin transactions.\n\nUsing Dash, payments are private and cannot be tracked along with balances. Dash harnesses the power of its Masternode network to power an innovative technology called InstantX. When sending funds, users can use InstantX and transactions will be fully sent and irreversible within four seconds. \n\nDash was released on the 18th January 2014 with zero premine coins. It uses 11 rounds of hashing algorithm namely blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, and echo. As of the current design, there will only be 22 million Dash ever created, making it a deflationary currency."

Sharding is analogous to the concept of 'divide and conquer', where transactions are divided into smaller groups for miners to perform parallel transactional verification. The upshot of this is the ability to reach consensus more quickly, which would increase the number of transactions in a given period. According to the white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion. "

This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits.

Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds. Should users desire access to off-chain data, they can submit a requesting contract to ChainLink\u2019s network. These contracts will match the requesting contract with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The aggregating contract gathers data of the selected oracles to find the most accurate result."

The main goal of the project is to facilitate fast, anonymous, and untraceable transactions. Bytecoin claims to be the first project to implement CryptoNote technology. Its security reportedly comes from using ring signatures to protect a sender's identity and unlinkable addresses to prevent blockchain analysis. Bytecoin claims to have a block time of 2 minutes and adaptive parameters that are designed to make it easy to mine. Recent additions to Bytecoin technology include Auditable Wallets, which reportedly enables secure, publicly observable deposits, and Blockchain Gateways, a means of connecting Bytecoin's blockchain with other blockchains."

Verge uses the anonymity tool Tor and an anonymous network layer I2P to hide specific transactions\u2019 IP addresses and locations. Transaction speed on Verge is estimated to be at 5 seconds due to the use of Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obfuscates the IP addresses of users. The introduction of the Wraith Protocol upgrade enables users to send and receive payments privately across the Verge blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services. Verge users are reportedly able to switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain. Verge offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining - Lyra2rev2, Scrypt, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl."

It also powers real applications via social apps like Steemit. \n\nSteem started out as the cryptocurrency on the Steemit platform that rewards users for community building through the upvoting and the posting of meaningful content. Founded in 2016 by Ned Scott and BitShares creator Dan Larimer, the Steemit platform, built atop the Steem blockchain, is a social media network that seeks to be a source of community-driven curated content such as news, Q&A and job boards. The more value a particular piece of content is able to deliver across a greater number of people, the greater the reward received by the creator. Steemit users can cast votes to create a hierarchy of content. The higher the upvote count received on a content piece, the more Steem is earned by its publisher. Steemit\u2019s meritocratic system also enables users that hold more currency to cast more meaningful, greater influence votes. "

According to technical documents, the platform connects invoice sellers directly to buyers granting expedited access to funds for the sellers offering their invoices at a discount to buyers. Appropriate discounts may be applied based on mathematical ratios that assess risk factors such as profitability, leverage, solvency and activity as variables that could predict the likelihood of bankruptcy. In this arrangement, invoice buyers intending to take advantage of these discounts by transacting using the native Ethereum-based PPT tokens on the platform would receive the amount previously agreed upon once invoices are paid by the debtor."

Users can also receive payment for renting their extra disk space. Files are split up into smaller components and dispersed across an array of devices, with users maintaining control of their keys, which grants them access to their files, at all times. As a result, this decentralised cloud storage model creates additional security for users relative to centralized cloud storage providers."

ProximaX will build a P2P cloud storage architecture with fault tolerance and a distributed database by removing the central entity and connecting all the servers (or nodes) in a mesh configuration. Failure of any single component of the mesh will have minimal effect upon the overall performance of the system. ProximaX protocol will ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data passing through a myriad of nodes. The use of distributed databases (DHT) ensures consistency and integrity throughout the network."

MetaApps constitute a platform for building stand-alone decentralized applications that may be written in several languages such as C++, PHP, and Solidity. MetaGate, a user interface with an open source for third-party developers. Finally, MHC is a digital asset that acts as a means of payment in the network and is meant to provide consensus along with the regulation of the financing for network development."

It is purportedly able to support 50K transactions per second and uses a Hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism makes use of value-added computation through the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. MATRIX Intelligent Contracts use Natural Language Programming and adaptive deep learning-based templates to auto-code. MAN tokens are mined and used to power real-world applications. The project has reportedly collaborated with Beijing cancer Research hospital to improve speed and accuracy of a cancer diagnosis."
